I show the possible completions in a menu like appearance. The user may choose an entry from my list and complete the word he was typing in the editor. I'm showed with the Tab key and will be deleted when with ESC key or when a successful completion occurs. The following keystrokes are supported:

Ctrl-Space or Tab: Open a new morph. Tab requires at least one character in front of the cursor. When already open complete the selected entry. 
Esc: Close me
Ctrl+u: Change to untyped mode, so I show all selectors of all classes in the system and the variables that are accessible to the current context.
Arrow Up: Move one entry up.
Arrow Down: Move one entry down
Enter: (like Ctrl-Space and Tab): Complete with the selected item and close the morph
any letter or digit: Narrow the completion further
Ctrl+t: Toggle the expand flag. When expand is disabled, you don't see selectors belonging to Object and ProtoObject.
